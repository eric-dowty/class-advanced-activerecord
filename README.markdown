# Blogger Advanced -- Perf Workshop

This is a branch of the blogger project intended for a performance
optimization workshop at Turing. The project includes several tweaks to
produce some performance issues for students to troubleshoot, including:

* Larger seed file
* Switched DB to Postgres
* Pre-built DB dump to expedite seeding data
* Skylight.io installation to aid in diagnosing perf bottlenecks
* Caching libraries included

## Getting Started -- Checking Out the Branch and Loading Sample Data

Since generating a large amount of sample data via a DB seed task takes
time, this branch includes a pre-built dataset in the form of a postgres
DB dump. This is a data format similar to what you might use to backup a
production postgres system.

A `pg_dump` is basically a direct snapshot of all the data contained in
the DB at a given time. As such it's much quicker for your local
postgres server to load all this data than it would be for you to
re-generate all the data via the seed task yourself.

To get set up with the app, checkout the branch, and load the sample
data, run these commands:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/JumpstartLab/blogger_advanced.git
cd blogger_advanced
git checkout -t origin/blogger-perf-workshop
bundle
rake sample_data:load
```

You should see a bunch of output from postgres as it loads up each table
from the db dump. Once it finishes, you can verify your dataset by
firing up a rails console and checking counts for our models:

```
rails c
Loading development environment (Rails 4.1.10)
irb(main):001:0> Article.count
   (21.7ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "articles"
=> 70001
```

## Dependencies for blogger-perf-workshop branch

This branch is intended to be a playground for exploring some additional
caching and optimization features, and as such it requires a few
additional dependencies. Make sure you have:

* Postgres installed and running
* Redis installed and running
* Memcached installed and running

## Caching Utilities

__Memcached__

This app comes pre-configured with Dalli (a ruby memcached client) as
its cache store. Anywhere in the app you can use `Rails.cache` to read
or write data to/from memcached.

Remember that memcached is best used for short-term data that can be
easily re-generated if it expires or gets evicted by the cache server.
One of the main differences between redis and memcached is that a
memcached server will evict keys as necessary if it starts to run out of
space, so consider this when deciding what data to write to the cache.

__Redis__

This branch also includes a pre-configured redis connection intended for
use caching data. This is set up in `config/initializers/redis.rb`. The
connection is configured to use a namespace for all of our data and is
assigned to a constant which can be accessed from anywhere in the app.
e.g:

```
REDIS.set("my-key", "my-value")
REDIS.get("my-key")
=> "my-value"
```

Redis and memcached serve similar niches in a rails production stack,
but most developers tend to use redis for caching smaller, specific
pieces of data. Unlike memcached, redis won't evict your keys when it
fills up, although it does set include a time-based expiration for all
keys by default.

Things that make a good fit for redis include

* Ids or slugs of specific data entities ("most popular article", "most
  frequently read author", etc)
* Small JSON payloads describing important or expensive-to-generate data
* Sets or collections of data ("ids of all articles for a tag", etc --
  read up on some of redis' set-manipulation features if you find
  yourself doing this frequently)

## Performance Auditing

This branch of blogger comes pre-configured with the NewRelic RPM agent.
NewRelic includes a simplified version of the monitoring tools in the
development environment. With your server running, visit
[http://localhost:3000/newrelic](http://localhost:3000/newrelic) to see
a quick performance summary of your recent web requests.

It should look something like:
